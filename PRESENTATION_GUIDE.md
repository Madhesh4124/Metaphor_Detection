## üé§ Presentation Structure (7-10 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (1 minute)

**What to say:**
> "Hello everyone. Today I'll present a Multilingual Metaphor Detection and Translation system that can identify metaphorical expressions in Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada, and translate them to English."

**Key points to mention:**
- Problem: Understanding metaphors across Indian languages
- Solution: AI-powered detection using transformer models
- Impact: Helps in language learning, translation, and NLP research

---

### 2. Problem Statement (1 minute)

**What to say:**
> "Metaphors are common in everyday language but difficult for machines to understand. For example, in Hindi, '‡§µ‡§π ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§õ‡•Ç ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à' literally means 'he is touching the sky,' but metaphorically means 'he is achieving great success.' Our system can automatically detect such metaphors."

**Key points:**
- Metaphors are language-specific
- Literal translation loses meaning
- Important for NLP applications

---

### 3. Live Demo (3-4 minutes)

#### Demo Script:

**Step 1: Show the Interface**
> "Here's our web application. It has a clean, modern interface with support for text and speech input."

**Step 2: Hindi Metaphor Example**
```
Type/Paste: ‡§µ‡§π ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§õ‡•Ç ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à
Click: Analyze
```

> "Let me enter a Hindi metaphor. The system automatically detects it's Hindi, classifies it as a metaphor with 92% confidence, and provides the English translation."

**Step 3: Tamil Normal Sentence**
```
Type/Paste: ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æ≥‡Øç‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ±‡Øá‡Æ©‡Øç
Click: Analyze
```

> "Now let's try a normal Tamil sentence. Notice how the result box is green instead of blue, indicating it's not a metaphor."

**Step 4: Kannada Example**
```
Type/Paste: ‡≤Ö‡≤µ‡≤®‡≥Å ‡≤¨‡≥Ü‡≤Ç‡≤ï‡≤ø‡≤Ø‡≤Ç‡≤§‡≥Ü ‡≤ï‡≥ã‡≤™‡≤ó‡≥ä‡≤Ç‡≤°‡≤®‡≥Å
Click: Analyze
```

> "And here's a Kannada metaphor. The system correctly identifies the language and detects the metaphorical expression."

**Step 5: Show Features**
- Point out the confidence score
- Show the color coding (blue for metaphor, green for normal)
- Mention the speech input button (if implemented)
- Click Reset to clear

---

### 4. Technical Architecture (2 minutes)

## ‚ùì Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q1: How did you train the models?

**Answer:**
> "We used pre-trained transformer models (XLM-RoBERTa and Kannada-BERT) and fine-tuned them on metaphor detection datasets. The models were trained using binary classification with metaphor and normal text examples."

### Q2: What's the accuracy of your system?

**Answer:**
> "Language detection achieves over 90% accuracy. Metaphor detection varies by language but typically ranges from 85-92%. The confidence scores help identify uncertain predictions."

### Q3: Can it handle mixed language text?

**Answer:**
> "Currently, the system is designed for single-language input. Mixed language text may cause detection errors. This is a planned enhancement for future versions."

### Q4: How long does processing take?

**Answer:**
> "Model loading takes 10-30 seconds at startup (one-time). Each prediction takes 2-5 seconds, which includes language detection, tokenization, and model inference."

### Q5: Can you add more languages?

**Answer:**
> "Yes, the architecture is extensible. We can add more languages by training or fine-tuning models for those languages and updating the language detection logic."

### Q6: What about speech recognition?

**Answer:**
> "The frontend has speech recording capability. We plan to integrate OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate multilingual speech-to-text conversion."

### Q7: How do you handle errors?

**Answer:**
> "The system has comprehensive error handling. Empty inputs, unsupported languages, and server errors all show user-friendly error messages. The backend logs errors for debugging."

### Q8: Can this be deployed online?

**Answer:**
> "Yes, we can deploy it using Docker containers on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. We'd need to consider model size and inference costs."

### Q9: What datasets did you use?

**Answer:**
> "We used metaphor-annotated datasets for Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. The models were fine-tuned on these datasets with examples of both metaphorical and literal text."

### Q10: How accurate is the translation?

**Answer:**
> "Currently, translation is a placeholder. We plan to integrate IndicTrans2, which is specifically designed for Indian language translation and maintains better context."

## üåü Making It Memorable

### Opening Hook:
> "Imagine telling someone 'break a leg' before their performance. A human understands it's encouragement, but a computer might call an ambulance! That's the challenge of understanding metaphors."

### Closing Statement:
> "Language is what makes us human, and metaphors are the poetry of language. By teaching machines to understand metaphors, we're bridging the gap between human creativity and artificial intelligence."
